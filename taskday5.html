        <h3>1. What is the purpose of the three dots (...) in if...else and do...while?</h3>
        <p>The three dots (...) in examples like if...else and do...while are often used in programming tutorials to represent the presence of more code. These ellipses indicate that there is additional logic or statements that should be added, which are omitted for simplicity or focus on the main concept.</p>

        <h3>2. What is the difference between the spread and rest operator?</h3>
        <p>The spread operator (...) is used to unpack or spread the elements of an array or object into individual items. Conversely, the rest operator (...) collects multiple values into a single array, often used in function parameters to handle variable amounts of input.</p>

        <h3>3. Why does the for...in loop produce an undefined output when accessing properties with the dot operator?</h3>
        <p>In a for...in loop, when accessing an object's property using the dot operator (e.g., `obj.key`), it looks for an actual property named "key". If you use the loop variable (e.g., `obj[key]`), it dynamically accesses the value of the property stored in the loop variable, which resolves the issue of undefined output.</p>
